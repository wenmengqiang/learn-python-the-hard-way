#every if-statment must have an else
#if this else should never be run because it doesn't make sense,then you must use a die function in the else that prints an error message and dies,just like what we did in the last exercise.This will find many errors.
#never nest if-statments more than two deep and always try to do them one deep.
#Treat if-statments like paragraphs,where each if,elif,else grouping is like a set of sentences.Put blank lines before and after.
#Your boolean tests should be simple.if they are complex,move their calculations to variables earlier in your function and use a good name for the variable.
############     rules	for   if-loops         #########

#use a while-loop only to loop forever,and that means probably never.This only applies to python.
#use a for-loop for all other kinds of looping,especially if there is a fixed or limited number of things to loop over.

#do not use a "debugger".a debugger is like doing a full-body scan on a sick person.you do not get any secific useful information,and you find a whole lot of information that doesn't help and is just confusing.
#the best way to debug a program is to use print to print out the valuses of variables at points in the program to see where they go wrong.
#make sure parts of your programs work as you work on them.do not write massive files of code before you try to run them.code a little ,run a little, fix a little.
